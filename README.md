# Policyengine-taxsim
TAXSIM emulator using the PolicyEngine US federal and state tax calculator

## How to use the emulator ##
The emulator takes a .csv file in the form of a csv. This is the same form of input that Taxsim-35 takes.

In terminal, run 

`python policyengine_taxsim/cli.py resources/taxsim35/taxsim_input.csv `

Output will be generated as `output.csv` in the same directory
